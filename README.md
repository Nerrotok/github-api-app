# github-api-app

## Description
An app which uses Github's rest API to search for users and display their information as a web app. It uses a search bar to select a user, then 5 of their repos will appear. Clicking on them will show information about these repos including their latest 5 commits or less.

This was built with React.js, Express and Node.
